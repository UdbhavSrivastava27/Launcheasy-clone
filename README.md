### `Features`

Figma Design Cloning: The project accurately replicates the design and layout of a Figma file, ensuring fidelity to the original design.

React.js Implementation: The project is built entirely using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React components are used to modularize the codebase and enhance reusability.

Tailwind CSS Styling: Tailwind CSS is utilized for styling the components, allowing for rapid development and easy customization through utility classes.

Animations: The project incorporates animations to enhance the user experience and add visual appeal. Animations are implemented using CSS transitions and libraries like react-spring.

Responsive Design: The layout is designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal viewing experience across various devices and screen sizes. Media queries and Tailwind CSS responsive classes are used to achieve responsiveness.





# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
